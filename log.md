# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 24, 2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: I have started the 100daysofcode challenge. I am taking the time to take a course about java.

**Thoughts:** I do not understand what is going on but am hoping I will get something out of it. So far I have the keywords and basic terms in my memory. The application will probably throw me for a loop but I am ready. I am only on section 3 of the course that I am taking so I have a long while to go. I am also trying to learn how to push my mini projects from intellij to github.
