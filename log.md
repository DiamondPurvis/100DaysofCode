# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 24, 2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: I have started the 100daysofcode challenge. I am taking the time to take a course about java.

**Thoughts:** I do not understand what is going on but am hoping I will get something out of it. So far I have the keywords and basic terms in my memory. The application will probably throw me for a loop but I am ready. I am only on section 3 of the course that I am taking so I have a long while to go. I am also trying to learn how to push my mini projects from intellij to github.

### Day 2: February 25, 2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: I have made good progress on my java course. I have intelliJ and JDK installed. I have learned about variables, dataypes, operators, expressions, statements, codeblocks, and methods.

**Thoughts:** As I progress on, it is becoming easier to remember concepts. I have been commenting out notes on each section that I learn although I am trying to do better as far as note taking. I am not sure if I want web notes, github notes, or written notes.

### Day 5: February 28, 2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Today I will be building a react calculator.

**Thoughts:** We do not have instructions on how to build this calculator, only design files. I am confident I can get something to work and resemble this calculator. Installing yarn takes a long time.

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned a little about class components in react.

**Thoughts:** I have no idea what I am doing. I have alot to re-read, and an entire lecture to re-watch as soon as the stream is uploaded. I plan on re-coding this project over the weekend as well to solidify my learning.
